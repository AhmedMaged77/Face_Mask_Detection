# Face_Mask_Detection
This is a README file for the Face Mask Detection project, a Python-based application that utilizes machine learning techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project offers three different options for detection: using the device's camera, using a mobile camera, and detecting masks in a selected image.
### Features : 
- **Camera Detection :** Real-time face mask detection using the device's camera.
- **Mobile Camera Detection :** Face mask detection using the camera of a connected mobile device.
- **Image Detection :** Detection of face masks in a selected image.
### Prerequisites :

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

-Python (version >= 3.6)

-OpenCV (cv2)

-Tkinter

-Mobile application (for mobile camera detection)
